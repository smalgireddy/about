    <h3> New York Taxi Trip Duration: Prediction </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Python, scikit-learn</li>
      <li> Machine Learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Elastic Net </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this project, the dataset that we choose was orig-inally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commis-sion (TLC). The data was sampled and cleaned for the pur-poses of Kaggle playground competition. Based on individ-ual trip attributes, we should predict the duration of each trip in the test set. In this context, we hypothesized that by our machine learning algorithms could be as predictive as the ones in scikit-learn and that we will be able to predict the trip duration with a Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) lower than 50% of the competitors.</p>

    <h3> Playing Doom with Reinforcement Learning and Linear Feature Repre-sentations </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Python, OpenCV, Reinforcement Learning: SARSA, Q-Learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this Project, our agent is in a closed room and has to battle against several demons that can be classified in two types: demons throwing fire balls (they only move to the sides), and short-distance attack demons that slowly approach to our agent. Both of them respawn. The specific characteristics of the game are as follow. The objective on each episode is to kill as many monsters. For every monster killed, 1 point is received, and for every time our agent is killed, one point is subtracted. There are three possible actions for our agent: turn left, turn right and shoot. To complete the goal proposed in the simulator, the agent needs to reach 15 as the best 100-episode average reward. To get 15 points in one episode our agent either has to kill 16 monsters before being killed, or kill 15 monsters without being killed. In this work, we create a machine learning agent that play Doom Defend Line, which is a scenario from the classic game Doom. We hypothesize that by using two different RL methods separately we can create an agent that is competi-tive enough to score 15 points in average through 100 con-secutive episodes which is the goal proposed in the simula-tor website.</p>
