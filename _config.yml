user_description: I am an Engineer by profession, Learner by aspirations and compassionate human being by nature. My research topics are Machine Learning, Big data analytics and Deep Neural Nets. I love programming, my passion towards programming made my coding expertise very diverse and flexible. I have four years of experience in the object oriented programming and Big Data analytics domain(MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark) with Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Big Data Engineer. Now, I have been working as data scientist intern with Accenture and as a research assistant at OU data analytics lab. As a Data Scientist I have worked on feature engineering, training regression/classification models, creating Ensembles, text mining, word-embeddings and deep learning models (Deep Neural Nets, CNN, GANS). I also worked on big data computation platforms and NoSql databases (HDFS, MongoDb and cassandra). My approach towards data science problem statement starts with domain understanding and ends with the feasible solution across all related domains.I am an Engineer by profession, Learner by aspirations and compassionate human being by nature.
